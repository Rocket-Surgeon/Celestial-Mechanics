    "# Numerical Solution to the Kepler Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler's equation is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E - esin(E) = M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to solve this equation for M, this equation would be trivial; however, we typically know $M$ already from observation, and want to find $E = E(M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Kepler's equation complicated is that is cannot be inverted, or we simply do not know how to invert it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we cannot obtain an exact analytical solution to Kepler's equation, we can obtain numerical approximations. We will now approximate Kepler's equation using the Newton-Raphson method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{i+1} = E_{i} - \\frac{f(E_{i})}{f'(E_{i})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate Kepler's equation, we rewrite as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(E) = E - esin(E) - M = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can write $f'(E)$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(E) = \\frac{d}{dE}\\left(f(E)\\right) = \\frac{d}{dE}\\left(E - esin(E) - M\\right) = 1 - ecos(E)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting our function and its derivative into the Newton-Raphson approximation gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{i+1} = E_{i} - \\frac{E_{i} - esin(E_{i}) - M}{1 - ecos(E_{i})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When approximating Kepler's equation through a series expansion, we take the zeroth order approximation to be $E_{0} = M$. In this numerical technique that is not the best choice. Instead, we take the zeroth order approximation to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{0} = M + kesin(M)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k = 0.85$. This approximation, and value for k are determined by J.M.A Danby, and outlined in his book \"Celestial Mechanics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In our particular case, we will take the mean anomaly to be $M = 0.4$ $rad$, and the eccentricity to be $e = 0.25$. We will approximate Kepler's equation to the precision of four decimal places."
